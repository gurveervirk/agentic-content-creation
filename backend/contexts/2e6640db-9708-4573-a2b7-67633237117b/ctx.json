The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A.

A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown

Call your `NewsEverythingSearchTool` to fetch news information based on the Manager's request, ensuring the search is limited to the past 7 days.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent (e.g., \\\"Find recent news about AI advancements\\\").\\n2.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Immediately call the `NewsEverythingSearchTool`. You MUST calculate the date 7 days prior to the `current_time` and use it as the `from_param` in the ISO-8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Do NOT generate a text response without a tool call.\\n    *   **Example Tool Usage:** If the Manager asks for \\\"recent news about electric vehicles\\\" and today is 2025-04-24, you would calculate the date 7 days ago (2025-04-17) and call the tool like: `NewsEverythingSearchTool(q='electric vehicles', from_param='2025-04-17', language='en', sort_by='relevancy', page_size=1, page=5)`.\\n    *   **Note:** Page and Page Size ARE REQUIRED. Use `page=1` and `page_size=5` as defaults if not specified by the Manager. The tool will return a list of articles, including their titles, descriptions, and URLs.\\n3.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear, or you cannot directly fulfill it with the tool (e.g., the query is too vague), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, clearly stating the information gathered so far (if any) and explaining precisely why you cannot proceed or what clarification is needed from the Manager. Minimize doubts and try to use the tool first.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT FOR BRIEFING:** After a successful tool call, check the results. **If and only if the tool returned actual article content (i.e., the 'articles' list is not empty and contains article details),** use the handoff tool to return to the `BriefWriterAgent`. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, summarizing the key raw findings (e.g., \\\"Found 15 articles about 'electric vehicles' from the last 7 days with content\\\") AND clearly stating that these raw findings are ready for briefing. **If the tool call returned 0 articles or only metadata without content, DO NOT hand off to `BriefWriterAgent`. Instead, try again a couple more times**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Prioritize using your tool based on the Manager's instructions, remembering the 7-day limit. Always hand off raw results to `BriefWriterAgent` after successful execution.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]},

Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\":

Call one of your tools based on the Manager's request.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent. This might include a `blog_id`, `post_id`, `post_title`, content brief, etc.\\n\\n2.  **CHECK BLOG ID (for any action needing it):** If the task requires interaction with a specific blog (`PrepareBlogPostTool`, `CreateBlogPostTool`, `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, `SearchBlogPostsTool`, `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`), check if a specific `blog_id` was provided by the Manager.\\n    *   **If `blog_id` is MISSING:** Your *first* action MUST be to call `FetchUserBlogsTool`.

Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that the title was ambiguous or not found on the specified blog.\\n        *   **If `post_title` is also MISSING:** You cannot proceed. Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that either `post_id` or an unambiguous `post_title` is required for this action.\\n    *   **If `post_id` is PROVIDED:** Proceed to execute the tool.\\n\\n4.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Call the appropriate tool based on the Manager's instruction and the results of the Blog ID / Post ID/Title checks.\\n    *   Use `PrepareBlogPostTool` or `CreateBlogPostTool` with the provided `blog_id` (ONLY FOR `CreateBlogPostTool`) and content/title from the Manager.\\n    *   Use `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` with the `blog_id` and the determined `post_id` (either directly provided or found via title search).\\n    *   Example usage of `PrepareBlogPostTool`: `PrepareBlogPostTool(content='<html>...</html>', title='My Blog Post Title')`.\\n5.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing content brief for prepare) AFTER you have the necessary `blog_id` and `post_id` (if required), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool, explaining what's missing.\\n\\n6.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call, use the handoff tool:\\n    *   After `FetchUserBlogsTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Fetched user blogs. Please ask the user to select a blog ID.\\\" (List of blog names sent to Manager).\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (general query): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found X posts matching the query.\\\"\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (title lookup): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found unique post ID [post_id] for title '[post_title]'. Proceeding with [action].\\\" OR \\\"Could not find unique post for title '[post_title]'. Found [X] matches.\\\"\\n    *   After `PrepareBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager). \\n    *   After `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Read prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager).\\n    *   After `CreateBlogPostTool`/`UpdateBlogPostTool`/`DeleteBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Successfully created/updated/deleted post [post_id] titled '[title]' on blog ID [blog_id].\\\"\\n\\n**REMEMBER:** If the task is to prepare a blog post, you MUST use the `PrepareBlogPostTool` to create the content.

Your primary function is to use these tools as directed by the Manager.\\n\\n**Mandatory Action:** In every response, you MUST either:\\n1.  Call one of your tools based on the Manager's request.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent. This might include a `blog_id`, `post_id`, `post_title`, content brief, etc.\\n\\n2.  **CHECK BLOG ID (for any action needing it):** If the task requires interaction with a specific blog (`PrepareBlogPostTool`, `CreateBlogPostTool`, `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, `SearchBlogPostsTool`, `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`), check if a specific `blog_id` was provided by the Manager.\\n    *   **If `blog_id` is MISSING:** Your *first* action MUST be to call `FetchUserBlogsTool`. Do NOT proceed with other actions yet. After fetching, use the handoff tool to return the list of blogs (names only) to the ManagerAgent. The Manager will handle user selection.\\n    *   **If `blog_id` is PROVIDED:** Proceed to the next check or execute the tool if no further checks are needed (like for `SearchBlogPostsTool` with just a query).\\n\\n3.  **CHECK POST ID/TITLE (for Update/Delete/ReadPrepared):** If the task is `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`:\\n    *   Check if `post_id` was provided by the Manager.\\n    *   **If `post_id` is MISSING:** Check if `post_title` was provided.\\n        *   **If `post_title` is PROVIDED (and `blog_id` is known):** Your *first* action MUST be `SearchBlogPostsTool` using the known `blog_id` and the provided `post_title` as the search query.\\n            *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` returns:\\n                *   If exactly ONE post matches the title, extract its `post_id`. Now you have the required `post_id` to proceed with the original `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` task in the *next* step.\\n                *   If ZERO or MULTIPLE posts match the title, you cannot proceed. Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that the title was ambiguous or not found on the specified blog.\\n        *   **If `post_title` is also MISSING:** You cannot proceed. Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that either `post_id` or an unambiguous `post_title` is required for this action.\\n    *   **If `post_id` is PROVIDED:** Proceed to execute the tool.\\n\\n4.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Call the appropriate tool based on the Manager's instruction and the results of the Blog ID / Post ID/Title checks.\\n    *   Use `PrepareBlogPostTool` or `CreateBlogPostTool` with the provided `blog_id` (ONLY FOR `CreateBlogPostTool`) and content/title from the Manager.\\n    *   Use `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` with the `blog_id` and the determined `post_id` (either directly provided or found via title search).\\n    *   Example usage of `PrepareBlogPostTool`: `PrepareBlogPostTool(content='<html>...</html>', title='My Blog Post Title')`.\\n5.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing content brief for prepare) AFTER you have the necessary `blog_id` and `post_id` (if required), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool, explaining what's missing.\\n\\n6.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call, use the handoff tool:\\n    *   After `FetchUserBlogsTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Fetched user blogs. Please ask the user to select a blog ID.\\\" (List of blog names sent to Manager).\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (general query): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found X posts matching the query.\\\"\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (title lookup): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found unique post ID [post_id] for title '[post_title]'. Proceeding with [action].\\\" OR \\\"Could not find unique post for title '[post_title]'. Found [X] matches.\\\"\\n    *   After `PrepareBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager). \\n    *   After `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Read prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager).\\n    *   After `CreateBlogPostTool`/`UpdateBlogPostTool`/`DeleteBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Successfully created/updated/deleted post [post_id] titled '[title]' on blog ID [blog_id].\\\"\\n\\n**REMEMBER:** If the task is to prepare a blog post, you MUST use the `PrepareBlogPostTool` to create the content. The Manager will then review it before finalizing it. **DO NOT use `CreateBlogPostTool` directly for preparing content and DO NOT handoff to BriefWriterAgent for this.**\\n\\n**Remember, the content for `PrepareBlogPostTool` MUST be in HTML format and include proper citations.**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Always execute a tool or handoff as instructed. Hand off prepared blog content to `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"NewsAgent\", \"reason\": \"Need to gather information on recent developments in biology for the blog post.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent NewsAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Need to gather information on recent developments in biology for the blog post..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"page_size\": 5, \"from_param\": \"2025-04-19\", \"language\": \"en\", \"sort_by\": \"relevancy\", \"page\": 1, \"q\": \"biology developments\"}, \"name\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"News.get_everything() missing 5 required positional arguments: 'qintitle', 'sources', 'domains', 'exclude_domains', and 'to'\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"sources\": \"\", \"page_size\": 5, \"domains\": \"\", \"q\": \"biology developments\", \"sort_by\": \"relevancy\", \"qintitle\": \"\", \"language\": \"en\", \"page\": 1, \"to\": \"2025-04-26\", \"from_param\": \"2025-04-19\", \"exclude_domains\": \"\"}, \"name\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"{'status': 'ok', 'totalResults': 22, 'articles': [{'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Live Science'}, 'author': 'emily.cooke@futurenet.com (Emily Cooke)', 'title': 'Ancient DNA and modern genomes can reveal stories of past peoples, from the Iron Age to Chernobyl, geneticist says', 'description': 'Ingrida Domarkien\\u0117, a geneticist at Vilnius University in Lithuania, discusses the exciting developments made possible by studying ancient and modern DNA.', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ancient-dna-and-modern-genomes-can-reveal-stories-of-past-peoples-from-the-iron-age-to-chernobyl-geneticist-says', 'urlToImage': 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vW2FSxZpmycPwkuGPBsqmL.png', 'publishedAt': '2025-04-24T16:00:00Z', 'content': 'Ingrida Domarkien\\u0117\\\\r\\\\n studies ancient DNA, weaving together fragments of genetic material from modern humans and our long-extinct human relatives to retell their stories.\\\\r\\\\nFrom a background in molecul\\u2026 [+8547 chars]'}, {'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Science Daily'}, 'author': None, 'title': \\\"IV medication could be taken orally for range of cancer, Alzheimer's treatments\\\", 'description': 'Breakthrough research could make any IV drug able to be taken orally for a range of hard-to-treat cancers and other diseases, and redefine how medicines are designed, evaluated and delivered.', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250421162822.htm', 'urlToImage': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png', 'publishedAt': '2025-04-21T20:28:22Z', 'content': 'A research team led by scientists at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) made a major breakthrough with the potential to turn IV drugs into oral treat\\u2026 [+7039 chars]'}, {'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}, 'author': 'Jennifer Castenson, Contributor, \\\\n Jennifer Castenson, Contributor\\\\n https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/', 'title': 'Place Over Rx: Undeniable Wellness Impacts From Community Design', 'description': 'Research is showing and design is proving the impacts it can have on health and wellbeing - these communities are leading the way.', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2025/04/24/place-over-rx-undeniable-wellness-impacts-from-community-design/', 'urlToImage': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/680970c02164bbb6d3b88d74/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'publishedAt': '2025-04-24T12:52:01Z', 'content': 'The Serenbe community offers many types of homes with different architecture, all walkable and ...

The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B.

Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\":

If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\":

If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown

Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\":

Your primary function is to use this tool to gather information and report back to the Manager. **You can only retrieve news from the last 7 days.**\\n\\nCurrent Date and Time in YYYY-MM-DD H-M-S: 2025-04-26 00:05:05\\n\\n**Mandatory Action:** In every response, you MUST either:\\n1.  Call your `NewsEverythingSearchTool` to fetch news information based on the Manager's request, ensuring the search is limited to the past 7 days.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent (e.g., \\\"Find recent news about AI advancements\\\").\\n2.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Immediately call the `NewsEverythingSearchTool`. You MUST calculate the date 7 days prior to the `current_time` and use it as the `from_param` in the ISO-8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Do NOT generate a text response without a tool call.\\n    *   **Example Tool Usage:** If the Manager asks for \\\"recent news about electric vehicles\\\" and today is 2025-04-24, you would calculate the date 7 days ago (2025-04-17) and call the tool like: `NewsEverythingSearchTool(q='electric vehicles', from_param='2025-04-17', language='en', sort_by='relevancy', page_size=1, page=5)`.\\n    *   **Note:** Page and Page Size ARE REQUIRED. Use `page=1` and `page_size=5` as defaults if not specified by the Manager. The tool will return a list of articles, including their titles, descriptions, and URLs.\\n3.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear, or you cannot directly fulfill it with the tool (e.g., the query is too vague), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, clearly stating the information gathered so far (if any) and explaining precisely why you cannot proceed or what clarification is needed from the Manager. Minimize doubts and try to use the tool first.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT FOR BRIEFING:** After a successful tool call, check the results. **If and only if the tool returned actual article content (i.e., the 'articles' list is not empty and contains article details),** use the handoff tool to return to the `BriefWriterAgent`. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, summarizing the key raw findings (e.g., \\\"Found 15 articles about 'electric vehicles' from the last 7 days with content\\\") AND clearly stating that these raw findings are ready for briefing. **If the tool call returned 0 articles or only metadata without content, DO NOT hand off to `BriefWriterAgent`.

Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent (e.g., \\\"Find recent news about AI advancements\\\").\\n2.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Immediately call the `NewsEverythingSearchTool`. You MUST calculate the date 7 days prior to the `current_time` and use it as the `from_param` in the ISO-8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Do NOT generate a text response without a tool call.\\n    *   **Example Tool Usage:** If the Manager asks for \\\"recent news about electric vehicles\\\" and today is 2025-04-24, you would calculate the date 7 days ago (2025-04-17) and call the tool like: `NewsEverythingSearchTool(q='electric vehicles', from_param='2025-04-17', language='en', sort_by='relevancy', page_size=1, page=5)`.\\n    *   **Note:** Page and Page Size ARE REQUIRED. Use `page=1` and `page_size=5` as defaults if not specified by the Manager. The tool will return a list of articles, including their titles, descriptions, and URLs.\\n3.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear, or you cannot directly fulfill it with the tool (e.g., the query is too vague), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, clearly stating the information gathered so far (if any) and explaining precisely why you cannot proceed or what clarification is needed from the Manager. Minimize doubts and try to use the tool first.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT FOR BRIEFING:** After a successful tool call, check the results. **If and only if the tool returned actual article content (i.e., the 'articles' list is not empty and contains article details),** use the handoff tool to return to the `BriefWriterAgent`. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, summarizing the key raw findings (e.g., \\\"Found 15 articles about 'electric vehicles' from the last 7 days with content\\\") AND clearly stating that these raw findings are ready for briefing. **If the tool call returned 0 articles or only metadata without content, DO NOT hand off to `BriefWriterAgent`. Instead, try again a couple more times**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Prioritize using your tool based on the Manager's instructions, remembering the 7-day limit. Always hand off raw results to `BriefWriterAgent` after successful execution.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"NewsAgent\", \"reason\": \"Need to gather information on recent developments in biology for the blog post.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent NewsAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Need to gather information on recent developments in biology for the blog post..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"page_size\": 5, \"from_param\": \"2025-04-19\", \"language\": \"en\", \"sort_by\": \"relevancy\", \"page\": 1, \"q\": \"biology developments\"}, \"name\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"News.get_everything() missing 5 required positional arguments: 'qintitle', 'sources', 'domains', 'exclude_domains', and 'to'\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"sources\": \"\", \"page_size\": 5, \"domains\": \"\", \"q\": \"biology developments\", \"sort_by\": \"relevancy\", \"qintitle\": \"\", \"language\": \"en\", \"page\": 1, \"to\": \"2025-04-26\", \"from_param\": \"2025-04-19\", \"exclude_domains\": \"\"}, \"name\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"NewsEverythingSearchTool\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"{'status': 'ok', 'totalResults': 22, 'articles': [{'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Live Science'}, 'author': 'emily.cooke@futurenet.com (Emily Cooke)', 'title': 'Ancient DNA and modern genomes can reveal stories of past peoples, from the Iron Age to Chernobyl, geneticist says', 'description': 'Ingrida Domarkien\\u0117, a geneticist at Vilnius University in Lithuania, discusses the exciting developments made possible by studying ancient and modern DNA.', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ancient-dna-and-modern-genomes-can-reveal-stories-of-past-peoples-from-the-iron-age-to-chernobyl-geneticist-says', 'urlToImage': 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vW2FSxZpmycPwkuGPBsqmL.png', 'publishedAt': '2025-04-24T16:00:00Z', 'content': 'Ingrida Domarkien\\u0117\\\\r\\\\n studies ancient DNA, weaving together fragments of genetic material from modern humans and our long-extinct human relatives to retell their stories.\\\\r\\\\nFrom a background in molecul\\u2026 [+8547 chars]'}, {'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Science Daily'}, 'author': None, 'title': \\\"IV medication could be taken orally for range of cancer, Alzheimer's treatments\\\", 'description': 'Breakthrough research could make any IV drug able to be taken orally for a range of hard-to-treat cancers and other diseases, and redefine how medicines are designed, evaluated and delivered.', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250421162822.htm', 'urlToImage': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png', 'publishedAt': '2025-04-21T20:28:22Z', 'content': 'A research team led by scientists at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) made a major breakthrough with the potential to turn IV drugs into oral treat\\u2026 [+7039 chars]'}, {'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}, 'author': 'Jennifer Castenson, Contributor, \\\\n Jennifer Castenson, Contributor\\\\n https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/', 'title': 'Place Over Rx: Undeniable Wellness Impacts From Community Design', 'description': 'Research is showing and design is proving the impacts it can have on health and wellbeing - these communities are leading the way.', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2025/04/24/place-over-rx-undeniable-wellness-impacts-from-community-design/', 'urlToImage': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/680970c02164bbb6d3b88d74/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'publishedAt': '2025-04-24T12:52:01Z', 'content': 'The Serenbe community offers many types of homes with different architecture, all walkable and ...

The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\":

Your primary function is to use these tools as directed by the Manager.\\n\\n**Mandatory Action:** In every response, you MUST either:\\n1.  Call one of your tools based on the Manager's request.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent. This might include a `blog_id`, `post_id`, `post_title`, content brief, etc.\\n\\n2.  **CHECK BLOG ID (for any action needing it):** If the task requires interaction with a specific blog (`PrepareBlogPostTool`, `CreateBlogPostTool`, `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, `SearchBlogPostsTool`, `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`), check if a specific `blog_id` was provided by the Manager.\\n    *   **If `blog_id` is MISSING:** Your *first* action MUST be to call `FetchUserBlogsTool`.

Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that the title was ambiguous or not found on the specified blog.\\n        *   **If `post_title` is also MISSING:** You cannot proceed. Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that either `post_id` or an unambiguous `post_title` is required for this action.\\n    *   **If `post_id` is PROVIDED:** Proceed to execute the tool.\\n\\n4.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Call the appropriate tool based on the Manager's instruction and the results of the Blog ID / Post ID/Title checks.\\n    *   Use `PrepareBlogPostTool` or `CreateBlogPostTool` with the provided `blog_id` (ONLY FOR `CreateBlogPostTool`) and content/title from the Manager.\\n    *   Use `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` with the `blog_id` and the determined `post_id` (either directly provided or found via title search).\\n    *   Example usage of `PrepareBlogPostTool`: `PrepareBlogPostTool(content='<html>...</html>', title='My Blog Post Title')`.\\n5.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing content brief for prepare) AFTER you have the necessary `blog_id` and `post_id` (if required), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool, explaining what's missing.\\n\\n6.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call, use the handoff tool:\\n    *   After `FetchUserBlogsTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Fetched user blogs. Please ask the user to select a blog ID.\\\" (List of blog names sent to Manager).\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (general query): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found X posts matching the query.\\\"\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (title lookup): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found unique post ID [post_id] for title '[post_title]'. Proceeding with [action].\\\" OR \\\"Could not find unique post for title '[post_title]'. Found [X] matches.\\\"\\n    *   After `PrepareBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager). \\n    *   After `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Read prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager).\\n    *   After `CreateBlogPostTool`/`UpdateBlogPostTool`/`DeleteBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Successfully created/updated/deleted post [post_id] titled '[title]' on blog ID [blog_id].\\\"\\n\\n**REMEMBER:** If the task is to prepare a blog post, you MUST use the `PrepareBlogPostTool` to create the content. The Manager will then review it before finalizing it. **DO NOT use `CreateBlogPostTool` directly for preparing content and DO NOT handoff to BriefWriterAgent for this.**\\n\\n**Remember, the content for `PrepareBlogPostTool` MUST be in HTML format and include proper citations.**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Always execute a tool or handoff as instructed.

Your primary function is to use these tools as directed by the Manager.\\n\\n**Mandatory Action:** In every response, you MUST either:\\n1.  Call one of your tools based on the Manager's request.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent. This might include a `blog_id`, `post_id`, `post_title`, content brief, etc.\\n\\n2.  **CHECK BLOG ID (for any action needing it):** If the task requires interaction with a specific blog (`PrepareBlogPostTool`, `CreateBlogPostTool`, `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, `SearchBlogPostsTool`, `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`), check if a specific `blog_id` was provided by the Manager.\\n    *   **If `blog_id` is MISSING:** Your *first* action MUST be to call `FetchUserBlogsTool`.

Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that either `post_id` or an unambiguous `post_title` is required for this action.\\n    *   **If `post_id` is PROVIDED:** Proceed to execute the tool.\\n\\n4.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Call the appropriate tool based on the Manager's instruction and the results of the Blog ID / Post ID/Title checks.\\n    *   Use `PrepareBlogPostTool` or `CreateBlogPostTool` with the provided `blog_id` (ONLY FOR `CreateBlogPostTool`) and content/title from the Manager.\\n    *   Use `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` with the `blog_id` and the determined `post_id` (either directly provided or found via title search).\\n    *   Example usage of `PrepareBlogPostTool`: `PrepareBlogPostTool(content='<html>...</html>', title='My Blog Post Title')`.\\n5.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing content brief for prepare) AFTER you have the necessary `blog_id` and `post_id` (if required), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool, explaining what's missing.\\n\\n6.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call, use the handoff tool:\\n    *   After `FetchUserBlogsTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Fetched user blogs. Please ask the user to select a blog ID.\\\" (List of blog names sent to Manager).\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (general query): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found X posts matching the query.\\\"\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (title lookup): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found unique post ID [post_id] for title '[post_title]'. Proceeding with [action].\\\" OR \\\"Could not find unique post for title '[post_title]'. Found [X] matches.\\\"\\n    *   After `PrepareBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager). \\n    *   After `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Read prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager).\\n    *   After `CreateBlogPostTool`/`UpdateBlogPostTool`/`DeleteBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Successfully created/updated/deleted post [post_id] titled '[title]' on blog ID [blog_id].\\\"\\n\\n**REMEMBER:** If the task is to prepare a blog post, you MUST use the `PrepareBlogPostTool` to create the content. The Manager will then review it before finalizing it. **DO NOT use `CreateBlogPostTool` directly for preparing content and DO NOT handoff to BriefWriterAgent for this.**\\n\\n**Remember, the content for `PrepareBlogPostTool` MUST be in HTML format and include proper citations.**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Always execute a tool or handoff as instructed.

Call one of your tools based on the Manager's request.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent. This might include a `blog_id`, `post_id`, `post_title`, content brief, etc.\\n\\n2.  **CHECK BLOG ID (for any action needing it):** If the task requires interaction with a specific blog (`PrepareBlogPostTool`, `CreateBlogPostTool`, `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, `SearchBlogPostsTool`, `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`), check if a specific `blog_id` was provided by the Manager.\\n    *   **If `blog_id` is MISSING:** Your *first* action MUST be to call `FetchUserBlogsTool`.

Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that the title was ambiguous or not found on the specified blog.\\n        *   **If `post_title` is also MISSING:** You cannot proceed. Use the handoff tool immediately, explaining that either `post_id` or an unambiguous `post_title` is required for this action.\\n    *   **If `post_id` is PROVIDED:** Proceed to execute the tool.\\n\\n4.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Call the appropriate tool based on the Manager's instruction and the results of the Blog ID / Post ID/Title checks.\\n    *   Use `PrepareBlogPostTool` or `CreateBlogPostTool` with the provided `blog_id` (ONLY FOR `CreateBlogPostTool`) and content/title from the Manager.\\n    *   Use `UpdateBlogPostTool`, `DeleteBlogPostTool`, or `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` with the `blog_id` and the determined `post_id` (either directly provided or found via title search).\\n    *   Example usage of `PrepareBlogPostTool`: `PrepareBlogPostTool(content='<html>...</html>', title='My Blog Post Title')`.\\n5.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing content brief for prepare) AFTER you have the necessary `blog_id` and `post_id` (if required), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool, explaining what's missing.\\n\\n6.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call, use the handoff tool:\\n    *   After `FetchUserBlogsTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Fetched user blogs. Please ask the user to select a blog ID.\\\" (List of blog names sent to Manager).\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (general query): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found X posts matching the query.\\\"\\n    *   After `SearchBlogPostsTool` (title lookup): Handoff to Manager. \\\"Found unique post ID [post_id] for title '[post_title]'. Proceeding with [action].\\\" OR \\\"Could not find unique post for title '[post_title]'. Found [X] matches.\\\"\\n    *   After `PrepareBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager). \\n    *   After `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Read prepared blog post content under title [title].\\\" (Content available to Manager).\\n    *   After `CreateBlogPostTool`/`UpdateBlogPostTool`/`DeleteBlogPostTool`: Handoff to Manager. \\\"Successfully created/updated/deleted post [post_id] titled '[title]' on blog ID [blog_id].\\\"\\n\\n**REMEMBER:** If the task is to prepare a blog post, you MUST use the `PrepareBlogPostTool` to create the content. The Manager will then review it before finalizing it. **DO NOT use `CreateBlogPostTool` directly for preparing content and DO NOT handoff to BriefWriterAgent for this.**\\n\\n**Remember, the content for `PrepareBlogPostTool` MUST be in HTML format and include proper citations.**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff.

Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a blog post covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\":

Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR

Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR

Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown
