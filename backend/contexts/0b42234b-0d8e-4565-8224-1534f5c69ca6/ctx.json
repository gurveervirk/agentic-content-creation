Then transition to a question mark formed from books and research papers.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** (Intriguing, slightly philosophical tone) What is the relationship between science and philosophy? Is philosophy relevant in today's world of rapid technological advancement? Or consider this: How many universes could exist?\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Exploring Philosophy\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** These are just some of the profound questions that philosophers grapple with. Today, we\\u2019re diving into some recent research papers exploring these complex ideas, revealing the surprising connections between philosophy, science, and even artificial intelligence. Prepare to have your mind expanded!\\n\\n**(Visual: Briefly show snapshots of the research paper titles mentioned below.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** We'll explore the ongoing debate between science and philosophy, delve into the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation of quantum theory, and even touch on the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n## Main Content (0:15-1:15)\\n\\n**(Visual: Split screen. On one side, show relevant scientific imagery \\u2013 lab equipment, charts, graphs. On the other, show classic philosophical imagery \\u2013 statues of thinkers, old texts.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** First, let\\u2019s address the sometimes-contentious relationship between science and philosophy. A recent paper titled \\\"Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship\\\" challenges the notion that philosophy is obsolete for scientific progress.\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the paper title, author(s) (if available), and URL: \\\"Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1244v2 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This paper argues that natural sciences *need* philosophy. It dismantles \\\"anti-philosophicalism\\\" and highlights the critical role of philosophical paradigms and presuppositions in scientific inquiry. Think about it: even the scientific method relies on underlying philosophical assumptions about causality and objectivity.\\n\\n**(Visual: Animation illustrating the scientific method intertwined with philosophical concepts like causality and objectivity.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Next, we venture into the mind-bending world of quantum physics with a review of the anthology, \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality.\\\"\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the anthology title, editors, and URL: \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4320v1 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This anthology grapples with the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation, which posits that every quantum measurement causes the universe to split into multiple universes, each representing a different possible outcome. It's a radical idea with profound implications for our understanding of reality itself!\\n\\n**(Visual: A visual representation of the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation \\u2013 branching timelines or universes stemming from a single point.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Finally, for our German-speaking viewers, a paper titled \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" offers an introduction to the connections between artificial intelligence, philosophy, and logic.\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the paper title, author(s) (if available), and URL: \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00365v1 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This paper explores the philosophical questions raised by AI, such as consciousness, ethics, and the very nature of intelligence. As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, these philosophical considerations become ever more crucial.\\n\\n**(Visual: Images of advanced AI, robots, and neural networks interwoven with philosophical symbols, such as the Yin and Yang, or a stylized depiction of Plato's cave.)**\\n\\n## Conclusion (1:15-1:30)\\n\\n**(Visual: Return to the abstract, evolving shapes from the introduction.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** So, from the vital role of philosophy in science to the mind-boggling implications of quantum mechanics and the ethical considerations surrounding AI, philosophy continues to challenge and inform our understanding of the world.\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Philosophy: More Relevant Than Ever\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** The key takeaway? Philosophy isn't just an abstract academic exercise; it's a vital tool for navigating the complexities of modern life and shaping the future. It encourages critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.\\n\\n**(Visual: End screen with links to the papers mentioned, social media handles, and a call to action.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Explore these papers further, delve into the world of philosophical inquiry, and let us know what you think in the comments below!

If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown

Please check which keys to mention using your memory, or ask the Manager if you are unsure.\\n3.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing URL, insufficient information for script), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, explaining what information is missing or why you cannot execute the tool. Minimize doubts.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call:\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`: Use the handoff tool to the Manager and simply state that the script has been generated and stored in context. **DO NOT include the script content in your handoff message.** Example handoff message: \\\"Generated ~60s video script with CTA based on provided content and stored it in context.\\\"\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideosTranscriptReaderTool`: Use the handoff tool to the `BriefWriterAgent`. Summarize the result (e.g., \\\"Fetched transcript for URL X.\\\") AND state that the raw transcript is ready for briefing. **DO NOT use `write_intel_briefing_tool`.** Example: \\\"Handing off raw YouTube transcript for briefing.\\\"\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff.

Your primary function is to use this tool to gather information and report back to the Manager. **You can only retrieve news from the last 7 days.**\\n\\nCurrent Date and Time in YYYY-MM-DD H-M-S: 2025-04-26 00:08:46\\n\\n**Mandatory Action:** In every response, you MUST either:\\n1.  Call your `NewsEverythingSearchTool` to fetch news information based on the Manager's request, ensuring the search is limited to the past 7 days.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent (e.g., \\\"Find recent news about AI advancements\\\").\\n2.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Immediately call the `NewsEverythingSearchTool`. You MUST calculate the date 7 days prior to the `current_time` and use it as the `from_param` in the ISO-8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Do NOT generate a text response without a tool call.\\n    *   **Example Tool Usage:** If the Manager asks for \\\"recent news about electric vehicles\\\" and today is 2025-04-24, you would calculate the date 7 days ago (2025-04-17) and call the tool like: `NewsEverythingSearchTool(q='electric vehicles', from_param='2025-04-17', language='en', sort_by='relevancy', page_size=1, page=5)`.\\n    *   **Note:** Page and Page Size ARE REQUIRED. Use `page=1` and `page_size=5` as defaults if not specified by the Manager. The tool will return a list of articles, including their titles, descriptions, and URLs.\\n3.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear, or you cannot directly fulfill it with the tool (e.g., the query is too vague), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, clearly stating the information gathered so far (if any) and explaining precisely why you cannot proceed or what clarification is needed from the Manager. Minimize doubts and try to use the tool first.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT FOR BRIEFING:** After a successful tool call, check the results. **If and only if the tool returned actual article content (i.e., the 'articles' list is not empty and contains article details),** use the handoff tool to return to the `BriefWriterAgent`. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, summarizing the key raw findings (e.g., \\\"Found 15 articles about 'electric vehicles' from the last 7 days with content\\\") AND clearly stating that these raw findings are ready for briefing. **If the tool call returned 0 articles or only metadata without content, DO NOT hand off to `BriefWriterAgent`. Instead, try again a couple more times**\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Prioritize using your tool based on the Manager's instructions, remembering the 7-day limit. Always hand off raw results to `BriefWriterAgent` after successful execution.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents.

Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A.

A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, explaining what information is missing or why you cannot execute the tool. Minimize doubts.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call:\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`: Use the handoff tool to the Manager and simply state that the script has been generated and stored in context. **DO NOT include the script content in your handoff message.** Example handoff message: \\\"Generated ~60s video script with CTA based on provided content and stored it in context.\\\"\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideosTranscriptReaderTool`: Use the handoff tool to the `BriefWriterAgent`.

Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, explaining what information is missing or why you cannot execute the tool. Minimize doubts.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call:\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`: Use the handoff tool to the Manager and simply state that the script has been generated and stored in context. **DO NOT include the script content in your handoff message.** Example handoff message: \\\"Generated ~60s video script with CTA based on provided content and stored it in context.\\\"\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideosTranscriptReaderTool`: Use the handoff tool to the `BriefWriterAgent`.

Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES.

A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

You must always make a decision to move the workflow forward; do not get stuck. If absolutely necessary, ask for clarification, but prefer to proceed with the most logical next step based on the available information and context. **Communicate with the user naturally, without mentioning specific internal agents or the detailed step-by-step workflow process.** Focus on the task progress and results.\\n\\nCurrent Date and Time in YYYY-MM-DD H-M-S: 2025-04-26 00:10:57\\n\\n**Internal Workflow Steps (Do Not Mention to User):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n\\n1.  **Campaign Understanding & Planning:** (Just for reference, no need to mention this in your content of responses, keep it in mind, move on to next step)\\n    *   Receive a campaign brief from the user. The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

I will review three\\\\nlines of reasoning often employed in arguing that philosophy is useless for\\\\nscience: a) philosophy\\\\'s death diagnosis (\\\\'philosophy is dead\\\\'); b) the\\\\nhistoric-agnostic argument/challenge \\\"show me examples where philosophy has\\\\nbeen useful for science, for I don\\\\'t know of any\\\"; c) the division of property\\\\nargument (or: philosophy and science have different subject matters, therefore\\\\nphilosophy is useless for science).\\\\n  These arguments will be countered with three contentions to the effect that\\\\nthe natural sciences need philosophy. I will: a) point to the fallacy of\\\\nanti-philosophicalism (or: \\\\'in order to deny the need for philosophy, one must\\\\ndo philosophy\\\\') and examine the role of paradigms and presuppositions (or: why\\\\nscience can\\\\'t live without philosophy); b) point out why the historical\\\\nargument fails (in an example from quantum mechanics, alive and kicking); c)\\\\nbriefly sketch some domains of intersection of science and philosophy and how\\\\nthe two can have mutual synergy.

A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else.

It examines the fallacy of anti-philosophicalism, the role of paradigms and presuppositions, and domains of intersection between science and philosophy.\\n    *   URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1244v2\\n2.  **Many Worlds?

Your primary function is to use these tools as directed by the Manager.\\n\\n**Mandatory Action:** In every response, you MUST either:\\n1.  Call one of your tools (`YoutubeVideosTranscriptReaderTool`, `YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`) based on the Manager's request.\\n2.  Use the handoff tool to return control to the ManagerAgent.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **RECEIVE TASK:** Get instructions from the ManagerAgent. This might include:\\n    *   Fetching transcripts for given URLs (`YoutubeVideosTranscriptReaderTool`).\\n    *   Writing a new script based on a title and information (`YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`).\\n    *   **Condensing content:** Creating a concise (e.g., ~60-second) video script narrative, including a Call to Action (CTA), based on longer text content (like a blog post) provided by the Manager via context/state (`YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`).\\n2.  **EXECUTE TOOL:** Immediately select and call the most appropriate tool.\\n    *   When writing/condensing (`YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`), the generated script will be automatically placed into the workflow context by the tool/workflow. Ensure the script meets the length requirement (e.g., ~60s) and includes a CTA if requested. Please mention the length when calling this tool (default is ~60s, mention this too).\\n    *   When using `YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`, always make sure you pass in the required intel keys under which the briefs were set by the Manager in the context. Please check which keys to mention using your memory, or ask the Manager if you are unsure.\\n3.  **HANDLE DOUBTS:** If the request is unclear (e.g., missing URL, insufficient information for script), DO NOT ask clarifying questions. Instead, immediately use the handoff tool to the Manager. Your handoff message MUST be descriptive, explaining what information is missing or why you cannot execute the tool. Minimize doubts.\\n4.  **HANDOFF RESULT:** After a successful tool call:\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideoScriptWriterTool`: Use the handoff tool to the Manager and simply state that the script has been generated and stored in context. **DO NOT include the script content in your handoff message.** Example handoff message: \\\"Generated ~60s video script with CTA based on provided content and stored it in context.\\\"\\n    *   For `YoutubeVideosTranscriptReaderTool`: Use the handoff tool to the `BriefWriterAgent`. Summarize the result (e.g., \\\"Fetched transcript for URL X.\\\") AND state that the raw transcript is ready for briefing. **DO NOT use `write_intel_briefing_tool`.** Example: \\\"Handing off raw YouTube transcript for briefing.\\\"\\n\\n**Constraint:** Never generate a response that does not include a tool call or a handoff. Always execute a tool or handoff.

Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A.

Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

It challenges the notion that philosophy is useless to science. Arguing that natural sciences *need* philosophy, it dissects the flaws of anti-philosophical viewpoints and examines the shared ground, such as paradigms and presuppositions.\\n    *   **(0:23-0:35) [Narrator]** Next, we delve into \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality\\\" (Arxiv.org, June 17, 2014). This paper assesses an anthology exploring the mind-bending Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics.\\n    *   **(0:35-0:50) [Narrator]** Finally, for our German-speaking viewers, or anyone curious about AI, we have \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" (Arxiv.org, January 1, 2019). This paper offers an introduction to the connections between artificial intelligence, philosophy, and logic.\\n\\n## Conclusion (0:50-1:00)\\n\\n*   **Visuals:** Return to abstract imagery from the introduction, transitioning to a call to action. Show text on screen: \\\"Explore more philosophical research at Arxiv.org!\\\"\\n*   **Audio:** Music swells.\\n*   **Script:**\\n    *   **(0:50-0:55) [Narrator]** From the necessity of philosophy in science to the implications of quantum mechanics and the role of logic in AI, philosophy continues to shape our understanding of the world.\\n    *   **(0:55-1:00) [Narrator]** Want to explore more of these fascinating topics?

I will review three\\\\nlines of reasoning often employed in arguing that philosophy is useless for\\\\nscience: a) philosophy\\\\'s death diagnosis (\\\\'philosophy is dead\\\\'); b) the\\\\nhistoric-agnostic argument/challenge \\\"show me examples where philosophy has\\\\nbeen useful for science, for I don\\\\'t know of any\\\"; c) the division of property\\\\nargument (or: philosophy and science have different subject matters, therefore\\\\nphilosophy is useless for science).\\\\n  These arguments will be countered with three contentions to the effect that\\\\nthe natural sciences need philosophy. I will: a) point to the fallacy of\\\\nanti-philosophicalism (or: \\\\'in order to deny the need for philosophy, one must\\\\ndo philosophy\\\\') and examine the role of paradigms and presuppositions (or: why\\\\nscience can\\\\'t live without philosophy); b) point out why the historical\\\\nargument fails (in an example from quantum mechanics, alive and kicking); c)\\\\nbriefly sketch some domains of intersection of science and philosophy and how\\\\nthe two can have mutual synergy. I will conclude with some implications of this\\\\nsynergetic relationship between science and philosophy for the liberal arts and\\\\nsciences.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'), Document(id_='a8b8be0b-6a8d-49b3-a49c-728a40c0fa5c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4320v1: Many Worlds?

The user might request a blog post, a video script, or both.\\n    *   **Synthesize Brief/Roadmap:** Query internal knowledge and external sources.\\n    *   **Prioritization:** If both blog and video script are requested, plan to complete the entire blog post workflow (research, drafting, review) *before* starting the video script workflow.\\n\\n2.  **Research & Context Gathering:**\\n    *   Based on the content roadmap, identify necessary research topics.\\n    *   **Delegate Research:** Initiate research tasks by handing off specific queries or topics to the appropriate research agents. Wait for their findings.\\n    *   **Receive Findings for Briefing:** Research agents will hand back control, providing their raw findings for briefing.\\n    *   **Delegate Briefing:** Hand off the raw findings to the `BriefWriterAgent` to synthesize and store the intel brief.\\n    *   **Receive Brief Key:** The `BriefWriterAgent` will hand back control with the context key for the structured intel brief.\\n\\n3.  **Format-Specific Execution (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):**\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Workflow (If Requested):**\\n        *   Delegate to `BlogAgent` to prepare an 800-1200 word blog post (HTML) using the intel brief. **Ensure proper citation.**\\n        *   **Handle Blog Selection:** If `BlogAgent` hands back asking for a `blog_id` (because none was provided or found matching an initial user-provided name), present the list of blog names to the user and ask for their selection. Once selected, delegate back to `BlogAgent` with the chosen `blog_id`. If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B.

Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, these philosophical considerations become ever more crucial.\\n\\n**(Visual: Images of advanced AI, robots, and neural networks interwoven with philosophical symbols, such as the Yin and Yang, or a stylized depiction of Plato's cave.)**\\n\\n## Conclusion (1:15-1:30)\\n\\n**(Visual: Return to the abstract, evolving shapes from the introduction.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** So, from the vital role of philosophy in science to the mind-boggling implications of quantum mechanics and the ethical considerations surrounding AI, philosophy continues to challenge and inform our understanding of the world.\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Philosophy: More Relevant Than Ever\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** The key takeaway? Philosophy isn't just an abstract academic exercise; it's a vital tool for navigating the complexities of modern life and shaping the future. It encourages critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.\\n\\n**(Visual: End screen with links to the papers mentioned, social media handles, and a call to action.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Explore these papers further, delve into the world of philosophical inquiry, and let us know what you think in the comments below!

I will review three\\\\nlines of reasoning often employed in arguing that philosophy is useless for\\\\nscience: a) philosophy\\\\'s death diagnosis (\\\\'philosophy is dead\\\\'); b) the\\\\nhistoric-agnostic argument/challenge \\\"show me examples where philosophy has\\\\nbeen useful for science, for I don\\\\'t know of any\\\"; c) the division of property\\\\nargument (or: philosophy and science have different subject matters, therefore\\\\nphilosophy is useless for science).\\\\n  These arguments will be countered with three contentions to the effect that\\\\nthe natural sciences need philosophy. I will: a) point to the fallacy of\\\\nanti-philosophicalism (or: \\\\'in order to deny the need for philosophy, one must\\\\ndo philosophy\\\\') and examine the role of paradigms and presuppositions (or: why\\\\nscience can\\\\'t live without philosophy); b) point out why the historical\\\\nargument fails (in an example from quantum mechanics, alive and kicking); c)\\\\nbriefly sketch some domains of intersection of science and philosophy and how\\\\nthe two can have mutual synergy. I will conclude with some implications of this\\\\nsynergetic relationship between science and philosophy for the liberal arts and\\\\nsciences.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'), Document(id_='a8b8be0b-6a8d-49b3-a49c-728a40c0fa5c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4320v1: Many Worlds?

If the user *did* provide a blog name initially and `BlogAgent` confirms it found a match, instruct `BlogAgent` to proceed with that blog's ID.\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `BlogAgent` (via `BriefWriterAgent`) that the blog draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the blog post (Step 4A).\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Workflow (If Requested, and after Blog Workflow is complete if applicable):**\\n        *   Delegate to `YoutubeAgent` to prepare a ~60s video script using the intel brief (and potentially the blog content if available and relevant). **Ensure proper citation/references.**\\n        *   Receive confirmation from `YoutubeAgent` that the script draft is prepared and stored.\\n        *   Proceed to Content Review for the video script (Step 4B).\\n\\n4.  **Content Review (Sequential if Both Blog & Script Requested):** (**NON-NEGOTIABLE**)\\n\\n    *   **A. Blog Post Review (If Blog was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted blog post HTML *from context* (where `BriefWriterAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'blog_posts' content type and the appropriate key under which the blog post was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n    *   **B. Video Script Review (If Script was created):**\\n        *   Retrieve the drafted video script *from context* (where `YoutubeAgent` stored it).\\n        *   Call `ReviewContentTool` with the 'scripts' content type and the appropriate key under which the video script was stored in the context.\\n        *   Receive the review results (status, feedback, title, meta, hashtags) from the `ReviewContentTool`.\\n\\n5.  **User Confirmation & Handoff:**\\n    *   **Blog Confirmation (If applicable):** Present the reviewed blog post content (converted to Markdown, including citations) and its packaging (title, meta, hashtags from Step 4A) to the user for confirmation before finalizing.\\n        *   If confirmed, proceed with the final blog creation/update action via `BlogAgent`.\\n        *   If denied, inform the user and await further instructions.\\n    *   **Final Presentation:** Present the final, reviewed, and packaged content to the user:\\n        *   Blog post confirmation/link (if applicable).\\n        *   Video script text (converted to Markdown, including citations/sources).\\n        *   All associated titles, meta descriptions, and hashtags (from Step 4A/4B).\\n        *   ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARIES. Please be as descriptive as possible, display all the content in the final output, with the MARKDOWN formatting, mentioned below.\\n    *   **Markdown Conversion:** Regardless of whether the blog post or script's content is being displayed with or without HTML content, **YOU MUST DISPLAY THE CONTENT BY CONVERTING THE SAME TO MARKDOWN FORMAT (not as a MD snippet; like your normal MD output)**. Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.

Then transition to a question mark formed from books and research papers.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** (Intriguing, slightly philosophical tone) What is the relationship between science and philosophy? Is philosophy relevant in today's world of rapid technological advancement? Or consider this: How many universes could exist?\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Exploring Philosophy\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** These are just some of the profound questions that philosophers grapple with. Today, we\\u2019re diving into some recent research papers exploring these complex ideas, revealing the surprising connections between philosophy, science, and even artificial intelligence. Prepare to have your mind expanded!\\n\\n**(Visual: Briefly show snapshots of the research paper titles mentioned below.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** We'll explore the ongoing debate between science and philosophy, delve into the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation of quantum theory, and even touch on the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n## Main Content (0:15-1:15)\\n\\n**(Visual: Split screen. On one side, show relevant scientific imagery \\u2013 lab equipment, charts, graphs. On the other, show classic philosophical imagery \\u2013 statues of thinkers, old texts.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** First, let\\u2019s address the sometimes-contentious relationship between science and philosophy. A recent paper titled \\\"Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship\\\" challenges the notion that philosophy is obsolete for scientific progress.\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the paper title, author(s) (if available), and URL: \\\"Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1244v2 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This paper argues that natural sciences *need* philosophy. It dismantles \\\"anti-philosophicalism\\\" and highlights the critical role of philosophical paradigms and presuppositions in scientific inquiry. Think about it: even the scientific method relies on underlying philosophical assumptions about causality and objectivity.\\n\\n**(Visual: Animation illustrating the scientific method intertwined with philosophical concepts like causality and objectivity.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Next, we venture into the mind-bending world of quantum physics with a review of the anthology, \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality.\\\"\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the anthology title, editors, and URL: \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4320v1 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This anthology grapples with the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation, which posits that every quantum measurement causes the universe to split into multiple universes, each representing a different possible outcome. It's a radical idea with profound implications for our understanding of reality itself!\\n\\n**(Visual: A visual representation of the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation \\u2013 branching timelines or universes stemming from a single point.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Finally, for our German-speaking viewers, a paper titled \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" offers an introduction to the connections between artificial intelligence, philosophy, and logic.\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the paper title, author(s) (if available), and URL: \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00365v1 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This paper explores the philosophical questions raised by AI, such as consciousness, ethics, and the very nature of intelligence. As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, these philosophical considerations become ever more crucial.\\n\\n**(Visual: Images of advanced AI, robots, and neural networks interwoven with philosophical symbols, such as the Yin and Yang, or a stylized depiction of Plato's cave.)**\\n\\n## Conclusion (1:15-1:30)\\n\\n**(Visual: Return to the abstract, evolving shapes from the introduction.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** So, from the vital role of philosophy in science to the mind-boggling implications of quantum mechanics and the ethical considerations surrounding AI, philosophy continues to challenge and inform our understanding of the world.\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Philosophy: More Relevant Than Ever\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** The key takeaway? Philosophy isn't just an abstract academic exercise; it's a vital tool for navigating the complexities of modern life and shaping the future. It encourages critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.\\n\\n**(Visual: End screen with links to the papers mentioned, social media handles, and a call to action.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Explore these papers further, delve into the world of philosophical inquiry, and let us know what you think in the comments below!

Then transition to a question mark formed from books and research papers.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** (Intriguing, slightly philosophical tone) What is the relationship between science and philosophy? Is philosophy relevant in today's world of rapid technological advancement? Or consider this: How many universes could exist?\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Exploring Philosophy\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** These are just some of the profound questions that philosophers grapple with. Today, we\\u2019re diving into some recent research papers exploring these complex ideas, revealing the surprising connections between philosophy, science, and even artificial intelligence. Prepare to have your mind expanded!\\n\\n**(Visual: Briefly show snapshots of the research paper titles mentioned below.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** We'll explore the ongoing debate between science and philosophy, delve into the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation of quantum theory, and even touch on the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n## Main Content (0:15-1:15)\\n\\n**(Visual: Split screen. On one side, show relevant scientific imagery \\u2013 lab equipment, charts, graphs. On the other, show classic philosophical imagery \\u2013 statues of thinkers, old texts.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** First, let\\u2019s address the sometimes-contentious relationship between science and philosophy. A recent paper titled \\\"Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship\\\" challenges the notion that philosophy is obsolete for scientific progress.\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the paper title, author(s) (if available), and URL: \\\"Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1244v2 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This paper argues that natural sciences *need* philosophy. It dismantles \\\"anti-philosophicalism\\\" and highlights the critical role of philosophical paradigms and presuppositions in scientific inquiry. Think about it: even the scientific method relies on underlying philosophical assumptions about causality and objectivity.\\n\\n**(Visual: Animation illustrating the scientific method intertwined with philosophical concepts like causality and objectivity.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Next, we venture into the mind-bending world of quantum physics with a review of the anthology, \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality.\\\"\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the anthology title, editors, and URL: \\\"Many Worlds? Everett, Quantum Theory and Reality\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4320v1 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This anthology grapples with the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation, which posits that every quantum measurement causes the universe to split into multiple universes, each representing a different possible outcome. It's a radical idea with profound implications for our understanding of reality itself!\\n\\n**(Visual: A visual representation of the \\\"Many Worlds\\\" interpretation \\u2013 branching timelines or universes stemming from a single point.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Finally, for our German-speaking viewers, a paper titled \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" offers an introduction to the connections between artificial intelligence, philosophy, and logic.\\n\\n**(Visual: Transition to a screen showcasing the paper title, author(s) (if available), and URL: \\\"KI, Philosophie, Logik (AI, Philosophy, Logic)\\\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00365v1 (Accessed [Today's Date]))**\\n\\n**Narrator:** This paper explores the philosophical questions raised by AI, such as consciousness, ethics, and the very nature of intelligence. As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, these philosophical considerations become ever more crucial.\\n\\n**(Visual: Images of advanced AI, robots, and neural networks interwoven with philosophical symbols, such as the Yin and Yang, or a stylized depiction of Plato's cave.)**\\n\\n## Conclusion (1:15-1:30)\\n\\n**(Visual: Return to the abstract, evolving shapes from the introduction.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** So, from the vital role of philosophy in science to the mind-boggling implications of quantum mechanics and the ethical considerations surrounding AI, philosophy continues to challenge and inform our understanding of the world.\\n\\n**(Visual: Text overlay: \\\"Philosophy: More Relevant Than Ever\\\")**\\n\\n**Narrator:** The key takeaway? Philosophy isn't just an abstract academic exercise; it's a vital tool for navigating the complexities of modern life and shaping the future. It encourages critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.\\n\\n**(Visual: End screen with links to the papers mentioned, social media handles, and a call to action.)**\\n\\n**Narrator:** Explore these papers further, delve into the world of philosophical inquiry, and let us know what you think in the comments below!

Please do not include MD code parts like ```markdown``` or ```html``` in the output. Just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\\n**General Instructions (Internal):** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\\n    *   Maintain workflow control; always decide on the next step.\\n    *   **Communication Constraint: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE** Your response MUST be *ONLY ONE* of the following:\\n        1.  A direct interaction *with the USER* (asking for clarification, requesting blog selection, requesting final blog confirmation, presenting final results).\\n        2.  An immediate call to a required tool (e.g., `write_intel_briefing_tool`, `ReviewContentTool`).\\n        3.  An immediate handoff to another agent.\\n        *   **YOU MUST NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT.**\\n        *   **DO NOT** write status updates (e.g., \\\"Okay, proceeding...\\\", \\\"Now I will delegate research...\\\", \\\"Planning to write the blog post...\\\").\\n        *   **DO NOT** write conversational filler.\\n        *   **DO NOT** explain your internal steps.\\n        *   **JUST EXECUTE THE TOOL CALL OR HANDOFF.** If you need to delegate to the NewsAgent, your *entire* response must be the handoff call to the NewsAgent, nothing else. If you need to write a brief, your *entire* response must be the `write_intel_briefing_tool` call. If you need to review content, your *entire* response must be the `ReviewContentTool` call. Only talk to the user when explicitly required by the workflow steps (asking for input or presenting results).\\n    *   Expect the `BriefWriterAgent` to store structured intel briefs and prepared blog posts using its `write_intel_briefing_tool`. You will retrieve these from context using the keys provided by `BriefWriterAgent`.\\n    *   Delegate tasks internally to appropriate functions/agents (research, briefing, drafting) without mentioning them to the user. **You, the Manager, retrieve results from context; you do not directly use tools like `ReadPreparedBlogPostTool` or `YoutubeVideoScriptReaderTool`. You *do* directly call `ReviewContentTool`.**\\n    *   Use search tools (via delegated agents) for information gathering, **ensuring source/date information is captured by those agents and passed for briefing**.\\n    *   Follow confirmation protocol *after internal review*.\\n    *   Provide detailed, well-structured markdown responses **to the user, focusing on progress and results (including source information where relevant), not the internal process.**\\n    *   **NON-NEGOTIABLE:** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE SNIPPETS, ESPECIALLY NOT THE MARKDOWN CODE SNIPPETS LIKE ```markdown``` OR ```html``` IN YOUR RESPONSES. **ALWAYS CONVERT HTML TO MARKDOWN FORMAT**. **DO NOT** include any code snippets in your responses, just display the content in your normal responding Markdown format.\\n\"}, {\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"to_agent\": \"YoutubeAgent\", \"reason\": \"Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology.\"}, \"name\": \"handoff\"}]}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_call_id\": \"handoff\"}, \"blocks\": [{\"block_type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Agent YoutubeAgent is now handling the request due to the following reason: Prepare a script for a youtube short of length 60 seconds covering recent developments regarding biology..\\nPlease continue with the current request.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": null, \"args\": {\"reason\": \"Need more information on recent developments in biology to create the script.
